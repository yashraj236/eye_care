# Eye Care - An app that will help you to take care of your eyes

## How does it work

- Eye Care will remind you every 20 minutes to look 20 ft away for 20 seconds.
- The main challenge is to stay disciplined, for that:
    - This app will plant a flower
    - Every time eye care reminds you, you should follow the rule
    - The more you stay disciplined, your flower will bloom happily.
